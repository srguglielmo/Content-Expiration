Content Expiration is a WordPress plugin to set an expiration date on posts or pages.

== Description ==

**Content Expiration** is a WordPress plugin that allows authors/editors to set an expiration date on posts or pages. The plugin is intended to be simple with easy-to-read code.

An expiration can be set by specifying a number of days (e.g., *expire in 90 days*) or a specific date/time (e.g., *May 10, 2018 at 10:00 PM*). Two weeks prior to the expiration date, the author of the post/page is sent a warning email. The author receives another notification email upon expiration.

When a post/page expires, it is **not** deleted. Instead, it is given a status of *Expired* and hidden from public view. Visitors to the site will receive the regular WordPress *404 Page Not Found* error.

The expiration can be reset by any editor or administrator of the site. They must log in and edit the expiration settings of the post/page.

**Content Expiration** is developed on GitHub. Please submit bugs reports and contributions on [the GitHub Project page](https://github.com/srguglielmo/Content-Expiration).

For general support and questions, please use the [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/content-expiration/).

== Installation ==

Install the plugin as you do normally. Once activated, you will have a widget to set an expiration date when creating or editing a post/page. Additionally, there will be a new column, *Expiration*, when viewing all posts/pages in the admin dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The timezone seem to be wrong! =

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/srguglielmo/Content-Expiration/issues/2). The plugin is currently hardcoded to the `America/New_York` timezone. This will be fixed in the next release.

= Can I set an expiration on custom post types? =

[Not yet](https://github.com/srguglielmo/Content-Expiration/issues/1).

= The page has expired but it's still visible to the public! =

Expirations are processed hourly. Wait a bit, then check again.

= Expired posts aren't listed on the All Pages screens! =

Expired content is not included in the *All* listings. This is a (seven year old) [bug in WordPress](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12706). Click the *Expired (x)* link to view the expired content.

= What's this MIT license? =
